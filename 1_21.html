    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia CSS">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
        document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World 
        Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
        and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control 
        in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
        by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in 
        the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between 
        the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
